- [ ] **Fix Vercel deployment path configuration**
  - [ ] Resolve "apps/web/apps/web" path issue
  - [ ] Deploy advanced search to https://spot-exchange.vercel.app/
  - [ ] Verify all new features work in production
  - [ ] Test search functionality end-to-end

### 1.2 Database Connection
- [ ] **Replace mock data with real Supabase integration**
  - [ ] Connect opportunity loading to Supabase opportunities table
  - [ ] Update opportunity listing to use real data
  - [ ] Fix opportunity details sidebar with real data
  - [ ] Test opportunity generation and retrieval

### 1.3 Search System Integration  
- [ ] **Connect advanced search to real database**

  - [ ] Implement opportunity expiration logic
  - [ ] Add opportunity editing for account managers
  - [ ] Test opportunity workflow end-to-end

### 2.2 Bidding System
- [ ] **Enhanced bid validation and business rules**

## ‚è≥ **PHASE 3: PRODUCTION HARDENING** (LOW PRIORITY)

**Timeline**: 1-2 days | **Impact**: Production monitoring & reliability

### 3.1 Environment & Configuration
- [ ] **Production environment setup**
  - [ ] Configure production environment variables
  - [ ] Set up proper database connection pooling
  - [ ] Configure CORS for production domains
  - [ ] Set up SSL certificates and security headers

### 3.2 Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] **Add monitoring and error tracking**
  - [ ] Integrate Sentry for error tracking
  - [ ] Add application performance monitoring
  - [ ] Set up database query monitoring
  - [ ] Create health check endpoints

### 3.3 Final Security & Testing
- [ ] **Security audit and testing**
  - [ ] Review all RLS policies for security gaps
  - [ ] Test authentication flows thoroughly
  - [ ] Validate input sanitization across all endpoints
  - [ ] Perform end-to-end testing of critical user journeys

---

## üéØ **SUCCESS METRICS**

### MVP Ready Criteria
- [ ] Users can register and create tenants
- [ ] Real opportunities load from database
- [ ] Advanced search works with real data
- [ ] Bidding system functions end-to-end
- [ ] Real-time features work reliably

### Production Ready Criteria
- [ ] All user journeys work without errors
- [ ] Performance meets acceptable standards (<2s page loads)
- [ ] Error monitoring and alerts configured
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Documentation for users and admins

---

## üö® **KNOWN ISSUES TO RESOLVE**

### Current Blockers
1. **Vercel Deployment**: Path configuration preventing deployment to correct URL
2. **Mock Data**: Dashboard still uses static mock data instead of Supabase
3. **Search Integration**: Advanced search needs connection to real opportunities table

### Technical Debt
- Environment variable management needs cleanup
- Some TypeScript types could be more specific
- Database queries not optimized for performance
- Missing comprehensive error boundaries
